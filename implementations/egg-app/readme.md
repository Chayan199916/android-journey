# App Description

### This app is the implementation of seekbar and count-down timer.

#### How this app works?

* There is a seekbar which controls time. User can drag the pointer between 0:00 and 10:00 and that is reflected in a textview.
* When User taps on start button seekbar gets deactivated and timer gets started. 
* When it reaches 0:00, a horn sound gets played and gives the chance to user to start again.
* If User chooses "Again?" then everything starts from beginning and the process repeats.
* Starting time has been set to 0:30.
