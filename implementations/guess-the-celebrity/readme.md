# App Description

## This app implements webscraping and image downloading using threads.

### How this app works?

-> This app needs active internet connection.

-> https://www.imdb.com/list/ls052283250/ - from this site scrapes names and image urls of celebrities.

-> downloads images and presents each at a time with the correct celebrity name and 3 incorrect ones.

-> User guesses the name, if guesses right, a message is displayed saying "Correct" and if guesses wrong, a message is displayed with correct name.

-> All these downloading images and scraping web content are done in seperate threads.
